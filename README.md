## About Cloud Build

[Cloud Build][api-reference] is a suite of Machine Learning products.

See the [Cloud Build client library docs][javadocs] to learn how to
use this Cloud Build Client Library.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You will need a [Google Developers Console][developer-console] project with the
Cloud Build API enabled. [Follow these instructions][create-project] to get your
project set up. You will also need to set up the local development environment by
[installing the Google Cloud SDK][cloud-sdk] and running the following commands in command line:
`gcloud auth login` and `gcloud config set project [YOUR PROJECT ID]`.

### Installation and setup

You'll need to obtain the `google-cloud-cloudbuild` library.  See the [Quickstart](#quickstart) section
to add `google-cloud-cloudbuild` as a dependency in your code.

## Troubleshooting

To get help, follow the instructions in the [shared Troubleshooting document][troubleshooting].

## Transport

Cloud Build uses gRPC for the transport layer.

## Java Versions

Java 7 or above is required for using this client.
